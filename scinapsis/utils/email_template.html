<p><u>Trial Task:</u><p>
<p>
In order for us to determine how easy it is for researcher, i.e. yourself, to look for information on our site, we have prepared a short list of tasks for you to complete.  Please try to complete them and let us know in the survey we will send out next week how easy did you find these tasks.
</p>
<p>Choose a new favourite protein from this list: <strong><i>LC3, PTCH, BIRC, CD97, HIF</i></strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to look up a figure for a particular immuno-technique (i.e. Western, or immuno-staining) for your new favourite protein.</li>
<li>Find the full text of the paper that show the above figure.</li>
<li>After you find the figure and the paper and you like the antibody that is used to generate them, try to buy that antibody (NOT by using a new window/tab).</li>
</ol>
<p style="background-color: #ffa">
Basically, these are general steps we follow when choosing an antibody to buy: 1) <u>find a nice figure</u>, 2) <u>read the full text</u> and then 3) <u>look for the product</u> on the company page.  Try to replicate these general procedures in our website.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><p>
<p>
Since this is still an early beta version, our database is limited, it is more than likely you will <strong>NOT</strong> find your favourite protein in our database.  However, the main point of this exercise is for you to test out the <strong>flow</strong> and the <strong>concept</strong> of the system.  Further, there are cases where the data in the figure does not provide information on an antibody that was used to generate that figure, i.e. accuracy issue.  We will be implementing a feedback system later for user to let us know if a figure is wrongfully placed.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your help!</p>
