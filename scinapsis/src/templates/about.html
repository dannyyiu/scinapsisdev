<div class="headline"><h2>About Scinapsis</h2></div>
<p>Scinapsis is founded by a group of life science researchers at the University of Toronto.  We understand and share difficulties common to fellow researchers.  We are passionate about increasing productivity of research by creating new tools to accelerate discoveries.</p>

    <div class="headline"><h2>Search By Evidence</h2></div>



            <p><strong>Peer-reviewed publications are the new catalog for laboratory consumables.</strong>
            Researchers often look for evidence-of-use in literature before buying a new antibody or reagent.  Scinapsis is a FREE service for scientists, providing <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>easy</strong> access to evidence-of-use for different antibodies and reagents in peer-reviewed literature.  Through Scinapsis, scientists will be able to search antibodies or reagents by evidence, as opposed to catalog number alone.</p>
